### Odd Even Linked List

- Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

### Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

- Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

### Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

- Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

### Kth Smallest Element in a BST

- Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth (1-indexed) smallest element in the tree.

### Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

- Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order. A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

</br>


### Number of Islands

- Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

### Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

- You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
